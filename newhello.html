			BEST SONG EVER

			Maybe it's the way she walked (Wow)
			<br>Straight into my heart and stole it
			Through the doors and past the guards (Wow),<br>
			Just like she already owned it<br>
			I said, "Can you give it back to me?"<br>
			She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"<br>
			And we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
			We knew every line, now I can't remember<br>
			How it goes but I know that I won't forget her<br>
			'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
			I think it went oh, oh, oh<br>
			I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
			I think it goes oh<br>
			<br>Said her name was Georgia Rose, (Wow)
			<br>And her daddy was a dentist
			<br>Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
			<br>But she kissed me like she meant it
			I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
			She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
			And we danced all night to the best song ever
			We knew every line, now I can't remember
			How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
			'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
			I think it went oh, oh, oh
			I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
			I think it goes oh
			You know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
			And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me,
			And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you, (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
			And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced how we danced
			How we danced how we danced (1, 2, 1, 2, 3)
			Howe danced all night to the best song ever
			We knew every line, now I can't remember
			How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
			'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
			(We danced, we danced, it goes something like, yeah)
			And we danced all night to the best song ever
			We knew every line, now I can't remember
			How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
			'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
			I think it went oh, oh, oh
			I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
			I think it goes oh
			Best song ever,
			It was the best song ever
			It was the best song ever,
			It was the best song ever
